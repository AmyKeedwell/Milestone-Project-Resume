# My First Milestone Project - My Resume

A website created for the purpose of future employers or colaborators to find out more about me on my journey to become a web developer. 

This is intended to be added to as I progress through the course, I will replace the example portfolio items with my work once I start to build up my own portfolio to showcase my skills.

Hosted on GitHub pages and respository on GitHub.
