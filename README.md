# My First Milestone Project - My Resume

A website created for the purpose of future employers or colaborators to find out more about me on my journey to become a web developer. 

This is intended to be added to as I progress through the course, I will replace the example portfolio items with my work once I start to build up my own portfolio to showcase my skills.

Hosted on GitHub pages and respository on GitHub.

## UX

This project is aimed at future employers and colaborators. The resume itself showcases my skills so far and will document my progress as I learn more coding languages and expand my portfolio. 

#### User Stories
* An employer seeking a junior developer.
* Another developer seeking someone to colaborate with on a project or simply find out more!

#### Mockups
I created two different mock-ups, one initally using balsamiq wireframes then with Figma. 

I changed my idea completely from my initial wireframe, changing the design to a one page scrollable site to make it look more modern.

[Initial Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/lavYTEY7B2frKxxIN4XMjM/Resume-Wireframe?node-id=0%3A1)

[Final Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/Rgv2pMbPDQQhSOYDuhGjwm/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

*The only element I have changed since my wireframe is to loose the google maps as I felt it was taking up too much space on the page and seemed unnecessary for the purprose of the resume.*


## Design
The colour scheme consists of complementary colours which were inspired by the colours in my header image and give the site a bright and clean feel. 


## Features
* Documentation - ReadMe File & Mockups
* Colour Scheme
* Bootstrap - HTML, CSS Framework
* Grid System - Columns and Rows
* Icons
* Responsive design - Mobile First
* UX elements
* User Flow
* Git - Version Control System
* GitHub - Remote Repository
* Deployed - Hosted on Github Pages

#### Features left to implement
I initially intended to add an animation to the skills section but found after researching that this mainly requires JavaScript - a skill I am yet to learn so will update this when I can. 

Instead, opted to add a hover effect to my skills to make the section feel more interactive.

## Testing
* Tested responsiveness using google dev tools. 

* Loaded my website on different browsers
    * Found that the portoflio videos do not center when opened in Internet Explorer - I have spent alot of time googling a solution but still unsure on how to fix this so is still an issue unfortunately. 

* Sent GitHub Pages link to family and friends to test on any devices and feedback if any issues are found. 
    * One issue flagged was that the navbar doesn't retract once a nav item has been clicked on - I aimed to finish this but couldn't find a solution without using JavaScript. 
    * One issue was that the social links in the footer were not centering on smaller screens. I changed the alignment and fixed this issue by removing the float class and centering the text.
