# My First Milestone Project - My Resume

A website created for the purpose of future employers or colaborators to find out more about me on my journey to become a web developer. 

This is intended to be added to as I progress through the course, I will replace the example portfolio items with my work once I start to build up my own portfolio to showcase my skills.

Hosted on GitHub pages and respository on GitHub.

## UX

This project is aimed at future employers and colaborators. The resume itself showcases my skills so far and will document my progress as I learn more coding languages and expand my portfolio. 

#### Mockups
I created two different mock-ups, one using balsamiq wireframes then with Figma. I changed my idea completely from my initial wireframe, changing the design to a one page scrollable site to make it look more modern.
